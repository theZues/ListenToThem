  This is a site where you can see some random inspirational quotes then if you want more, you can search books and follow the url to the google books site.

  ## Approach Taken

  This app was built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery.  I also used AJAX to call two different API's.  I wanted to start off my first ever project with a simplistic approach.  I wanted basic html and css so I could spend more time on the api’s, javascript and query.  I’m sure I will be updating this to look even better, but I did achieve my goal.  Here’s the link. (The GitHub web address has issues so I’m using this for now.)  https://mystifying-panini-5afc14.netlify.com


  ## Built With

  •	Freecodecamp’s Quote API-https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/free-api-inspirational-quotes-json-with-code-examples/311373
  
  •	GoogleBooksAPI through the RapidAPI website -https://rapidapi.com/raygorodskij/api/GoogleBooks?endpoint=apiendpoint_272ce1d0-f967-11e7-8ae7-5d4cb90ae0c8getAccessToken

  ## Problems/Things to work on

  I had the most problems with the API’s and how to grab the data.  Object notation really helped though and of course, trial and error.  I need more time with Flexbox for sure.
