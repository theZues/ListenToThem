  <h1>Listen To Them</h1>
    <p>I'm glad you're here.  I hope you enjoy their quotes as much as I have and consider picking up their books if the quote resonates.</p>
    <p>I'll never forget what I heard; "Read books to get into the heads of people who are successful and to see the mistakes they made so you won't repeat them."
